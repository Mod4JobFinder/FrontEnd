## About The Project

This application allows a new user create a profile and login. The user then can search and filter jobs based on city and position. Then they have the ability to save jobs and go to a user profile. In the user profile they are able to view additional details about the jobs saved and link to apply. Project included:

- Utilize Context API and React hooks for global state.
- Implement E2E test coverage of user flows using Cypress testing
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Deployment using Heroku

- [Deployed app](https://jobfinderfe.herokuapp.com/)
- [Project Brief and Rubric](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone.html)


#### Built With:

- React w/hooks & Context API
- React Router
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS
- Cypress
- Heroku


## Set-up Instructions

 visit deployed site [here](https://jobfinderfe.herokuapp.com/)

1. Additionally you can clone down the repo [here](https://github.com/Mod4JobFinder/FrontEnd)
2. Move into the JobFinder directory in your terminal.
3. To see the code itself locally, run `<name of text editor> .`
  - Run `npm install`
  - Run `npm start`
  - visit http://localhost:3000/


## Learning Goals

- Demonstration of React fundamentals including components, props, state, and JSX
- E2E (end to end) testing using Cypress
- Refactoring an application to utilize React Router
- Utilize Context Api and React hooks for global state management
- Rebase work flow using Git and Github.


## Challenges

1. Dealing with outside adversity over the curse of the project. This left the front end team down to one member for roughly half the projects time.
2. Integrating CI with the Cypress testing.
3. Initial planning to decide on MVP and core user flows.

## Wins

1. Implementing the MVP while dealing with outside adversity.
2. Utilizing Context Api for global state management for light/dark mode.
3. Partnership and better understanding of the back end team and their work.

## Future Iterations

1. Retrofit TypeScript into the application.
2. Map view of job salaries by region.
3. Circle CI implementation.
